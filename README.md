# java-tutorials
A backup for my Java Tutorials. These are all publicly available in a much better form at cis.gvsu.edu/~vandykti/Java

##about me
I am a Computer Science major at Grand Valley State University in Michigan and was building these tutorials for my brother. I'm also in a web development class and finally had an idea for a website I could make for people! I am very excited to have these available for people.
