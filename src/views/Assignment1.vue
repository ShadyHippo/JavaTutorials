    <h1 class="indentHeading">Assignment 1: The absolute Basics (basically hello world)</h1>
    

    <h2 class="indentHeading">Estimated Time:</h2>
    <p class="body">
      Estimated Time (beginner) : 30 minutes
    </p>
    <p class="body">
      Estimated Time (me): 1 minute (or less)
    </p>

    <h2 class="indentHeading">Objective:</h2>
    <p class="body">The objective of this tutorial is to do basically what we did in Assignment 0, but this time with less of my help. You're going to print your name to the Eclipse console :)</p>

    <h2 class="indentHeading">IMPORTANT:</h2>
    <p class="body">While it is true that this is literally just copy pasting what we did in assignment 0, I encourage you not to just go copy paste it. Wait an hour between, and don't look at assignment 0. See what you can figure out and learn. </p>
    

    <h2 class="indentHeading">Concept</h2>
    <p class="body">In Java, different logic is separated into files called classes. While we can have one massive class that has all our code, it's much better to be organized. This first lesson is creating a class, and making it so we can run the code inside.</p>


    <h2 class="indentHeading">Assignment: </h2>
    <ol class="body">
      <li>Using Eclipse, open a create a new Java Project.</li>
      <li>Create a new Class named Main</li>
      <li>Print out the text "Hi, I'm YOUR NAME HERE and I love coding!" to the Eclipse console</li>
    </ol>
    <h3 class="indentHeading">Your solution should output lie this when finished: </h3>

    <h2 class="indentHeading">Helpful Hints: </h2>
    <ul class="body">
      <li>A new Class is effectively just a new file for code. The filetype on these files is a .java file. The class you create will actually just be called "Main.java" in your file explorer. You don't actually have to use Eclipse to edit and run this file. You can use any text editor, and the command line going all the way down to something crappy like notepad. We prefer Eclipse because it has a lot of really helpful features for development like an easy way to run the code, an included debugger, syntax highlighting, compiling, linting, and many other features. See <a href="https://xkcd.com/378/">https://xkcd.com/378/</a> for pertinent comic (nano, vim, ed, cat, and emacs are all text editors)</li>
      <li>If you don't know how to do something, go to YouTube! YouTube tutorials are a great place to get started, and many times (especially with the basics) you can find someone doing exactly what you're trying to do!</li>
      <li>Are textbooks more your thing? Try this: <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/">Java Official Documentation</a>. This is the Java 8 official API or documentation. You can find detailed descriptions of literally every single Java class and function.</li>
      <li>See that red squiggle under your code? These are hints from Eclipse that you've got some kind of compile error in your code. Mouse over this section of code and Eclipse will give you what it *thinks* is the problem. Sometimes these are right, sometimes these are not.</li>
      <li>Does your code compile? Try running it! If you get red lines, take a look at the first error, it has a line number in it. This line number Java was unable to run. Start there! In the error there is generally a link to that specific line actually!</li>
      <li>Sometimes this line isn't the problem, but a method you called in that line. Look lower in the error message! This will have helpful information for where the rest of the error is coming from.</li>
      <li>Google your errors! Stack Overflow and other forums are very helpful for debugging those pesky errors you don't know.</li>
    </ul>
