    <h2 class="indentHeading">Objective: </h2>
    <p class="body">This will get everything we need in order to begin creating and writing Java code. The goal is to run our first Java Program!</p>

      <li><b>Installing a Java Development Kit (JDK)</b>
        <ol>
          <li>Go to <a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">Oracle's site for downloading JDK's</a></li>
          <li>Select the most recent JDK (at the time of writing that's Java SE 8u202. Download and install this.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li><b>Installing Eclipse: </b>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Go to <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/">Eclipse's site for installing Eclipse</a></li>
          <li>Select Eclipse IDE for Java Developers (select the build that goes with your Operating System</li>
          <li>Download and run the installer.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li><b>Writing your first Java Program: </b>
        <ol>
          <li>Open Eclipse (hopefully it finds your JDK, if not see helpful hints)</li>
          <li>Click on File > New > Java Project</li>
          <li>Give it the name assignment0 and click finish</li>
          <li>Notice a new file appeared in the files on the left.</li>
          <li>Click the dropdown</li>
          <li>Right click the src folder and select New > Class</li>
          <li>Name it Main and click Finish. <i>NOTE: Feel free to ignore the package warning for now. We'll get into that later</i></li>
          <li>Paste the following code into your class.


<pre><code class="language-java" >
public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("hi");
}</code></pre>


          </li>
          <li>It should look something like this:

          </li>
          <li>Press the green play button above, and then check the bottom of the screen in the "Console" window</li>
          <li>I've resized my windows and hidden some views, but you should see something like this:

    <h3 class="indentHeading">CONGRATULATIONS!</h3>
    <p class="body">You have now completely writing your first Java Program</p>
    
    
    <h1 class="indentHeading">Helpful Hints: </h1>
    <ul class="body">
      <li>If you're here because Eclipse hasn't found your JDK, I honestly don't know what the answer is, it happens to me almost every time I install eclipse, (like 5 or 6 times now) and I forget what the answer is like ever time. Google your error, and hopefully one of the first links is from "Stack Overflow" or a similar website. These forums will be very helpful to you in the future of your coding career. I use these sites almost every day, if not daily. Someone smarter than me and you will have pored over many lines of code, and read the error in depth, and hopefully has a solution. No matter what your error is, try Googling and going to Stack overflow before getting discouraged. If no one has a solution there, the best solution to your problem can be found below in appendix A.</li>
      <li>I only started the next bullet point so you'd see Appendix A before trying the real answer, google differently. If you can't figure out what the problem is, sometimes the error message showing isn't the problem. Look around at your code, did you forget semi-colons? Have you forgotten to close parentheses? This is general troubleshooting, and these errors are made a lot less once you have more experience. Also, use the debugger! The best way to learn how to use the debugger is to watch someone else do it, go on YouTube to learn this. It seems complicated at first, but it will click :D</li>
